Press Windows + R, type cmd, and press Enter.

In the Command Prompt, type: diskpart

Once inside diskpart, type: list disk

Identify the disk you want to work with (in your case, it seems to be Disk 1).

Select the disk by typing: select disk 1

Then, remove the write protection with the command: attributes disk clear readonly

After that, you can try to format or initialize the disk again.
