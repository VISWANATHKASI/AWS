sudo file -s /dev/xvdf   --> to know whether volume has any file system or not

sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf  --> execute this command if there is no file system.

sudo mount /dev/xvdf /Add_volume  --> use this command to mount additional volume to created directory.

# sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /data  --> use this command if volumes has partitions.


Note:

# sudo lsblk -o +UUID  --> for ubuntu to get id's of volumes

sudo vim /etc/fstab
